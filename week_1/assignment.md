## Practice

1. Buisness logic -> Controller

2. 10,000km => 10 * 10^6 m
Speed = 2 * 10^8

Per request -> Speed / (Distance * 2)
= 200 * 10^6 / 20 * 10^6
= 10



3. Ports -> 65535


4. v4 -> 32

5. v6 -> 128

6. Packet switched -> any information, in packetts


7. Which among the following options is correct about HTTP?

- It is a set of rules which web browsers and web servers use for communication.
- It is a stateless protocol.
- It generally uses port 80 for communication.
- [❌] It generally uses port 25 for communication.

## Graded


7. 10, 000 /s -> 150 kB

1500 10 ^ 3 kB/s
1500 MB/s
1.5 GB/s
12 Gbps



2. 12,500 * 10^3
speed = 2 * 10^8
time = 12, 500 * 10^3 * 2 / (2 * 10^8)
time = 12.5 * 10^-2 s
time = 125 ms
