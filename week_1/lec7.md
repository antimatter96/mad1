---

```bash
while true; do
  echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK \n\n$(date)" | nc -l localhost 1500;
done
```

Responding with HTTP/1.2
Send 'HTTP/1.1 '
Send Status Code '200 OK'
Send '\n\n' => Seperate header and data
Send 'Date'

netcat listen on localhost 1500
-> will ask OS to open port 1500 and listen
-> whenever a request comes to 1500
-> given to netcat
-> netcat will pass whatever comes from echo and send it to whoever asks


*time will be when port was opened [time of last request*

```bash
# Netcat output

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1500
User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
Accept: */*

```

Typical Request

```log
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1500
User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
Accept: */*
```

Only 1st line is Mandatory
In case of HTTP/1.1 we need to specify host -> can be possible that mulitple hosts on same machine
User agent -> optional but good
Accept -> '*/*' I can accept everythinh 

Response

```log
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 1500 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:1500
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
* no chunk, no close, no size. Assume close to signal end
<

'> -> Request data [BLANK line at the end is important -> tell server we are done]
'GET' '/' => Root
